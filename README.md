# Decision Tree Regression – Loan Amount Prediction

### Overview
This project predicts loan amounts using a Decision Tree Regressor trained on financial features.

### Steps
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Train-test split  
3. Baseline Decision Tree model  
4. Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV  
5. Model evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE)  
6. K-Fold cross-validation and feature importance plot  

### Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
